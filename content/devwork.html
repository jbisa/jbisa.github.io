      <p>During Hackathon at work, a couple of coworkers and I developed an iOS app to help children with Dyslexia read better. The video below is a demo about how it works currently. We have many aspirations to improve the app in the near future and would also like to create an Android version.</p>

      <p><a href="http://whatwouldyeezusdo.com/" target="_blank">WWYD</a> is a simple web application that plays random Kanye West music videos. It first started off as a project to learn about the <a href="http://mean.io/#!/" target="_blank">MEAN</a> stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and Node.js), which is a bit excessive for such a simple application, but it was for learning purposes. Although I got the MEAN stack working, I was unable to work with the Youtube API nicely within AngularJS so I decided to scrap it and go with the simpler Javascript/HTML5 approach. However, I did learn quite a bit by using MongoDB and Node.js and how to quickly build a fullstack Javascript application, how to deploy it using <a href="https://5apps.com/deploy/home" target="_blank">5apps</a>, and got to work a little bit with the Twitter and Facebook APIs. I hope to use this the MEAN stack successfully in a future project.

      <p>Computer Graphics was one of my favorite classes during grad school. I did some work with graphics and animation using <a href="https://www.opengl.org/" target="_blank">OpenGL</a>, but never anything on the web so I played around with some web animation using JQuery.</p>
