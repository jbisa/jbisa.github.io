      <p>During Hackathon at work, a couple of coworkers and I developed an iOS app written in Swift to help children with Dyslexia read. The video below highlights the current functionality and areas for improvement. We also aspire to create an Android version of the app in the near future.</p>

      <h2 class="center-text">What Would Yeezus Do?</h2>
      <p><a href="http://whatwouldyeezusdo.com/" target="_blank">WWYD</a> is a simple web application that plays random Kanye West music videos. It first started off as a project to learn about the <a href="http://mean.io/#!/" target="_blank">MEAN</a> stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and Node.js), which is a bit excessive for such a simple application, but it was for learning purposes. Although I got the MEAN stack working, I was unable to work with the Youtube API nicely within AngularJS so I decided to scrap it and go with the simpler Javascript/HTML5 approach. However, I did learn quite a bit by using MongoDB and Node.js and how to quickly build a fullstack Javascript application, how to deploy it using <a href="https://5apps.com/deploy/home" target="_blank">5apps</a>, and got to work a little bit with the Twitter and Facebook APIs. I hope to use this the MEAN stack successfully in a future project.

      <p>Computer Graphics was one of my favorite classes during grad school. I did some work with graphics and animation using <a href="https://www.opengl.org/" target="_blank">OpenGL</a>, but never anything on the web so I played around with some web animation using JQuery.</p>
