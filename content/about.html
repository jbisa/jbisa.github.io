      <p>Hi, my name is Jay and I'm a professional Software Developer living in Boston. I am a full stack developer who is involved in 
	solving complex business problems on the back end, as well as creating sleek and responsive web applications to improve user
	experience on the front end.</p>

      <p>Outside of work I enjoy developing web and iOS applications, producing music, and photography. Check out my 
	<span ng-click="setSelectedFromLink('portfolio')"><a href="#/portfolio">projects</a></span>.</p> 

      <p>I never get tired of kicking it with my friends, debating music, and Boston sports. Lastly, I like my coffee black and my 
	drink dark.
